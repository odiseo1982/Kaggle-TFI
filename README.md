# Kaggle-TFI

This is the R project program I develop for the Kaggle TFI Restaurant Revenue Prediction competition. In the final results, it scored 301/2257.

It consists of a log lin regression model over a subset of variables, chosen from log lin univariate regression models. Then, this regression is an input to a random forest model.
